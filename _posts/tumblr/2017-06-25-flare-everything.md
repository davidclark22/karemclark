If you follow my blog, you know by now that flare anything I have to have it, except jeans! This dress is one of my favorite for summer because of the fabric, the color and for the girly shape. I love to believe that I’m tough when I squat 140 lbs, but I also like being feminine sometimes, specially on Sundays. This dress can be dress down with sandals and a hat[(like this)](http://karemclark.com/post/2015-06-22-summer-dress/), to go to a BBQ, or a festival. But today I dress it up for church with peep-toe shoeties which I’m also obsessed for how cute and comfortable they are. I seriously went to church for three hours and got back home to cook and I my feet did not hurt at all. But anyway, I wanted to talk about this dress because every time I talk about fashion is to tell you how you don’t need to follow the trends. An I’ve had this dress for years, and it’s still one of my favorite! You should find things that are timeless for you and that go with your style. I hope that You have an amazing week! Xoxo
