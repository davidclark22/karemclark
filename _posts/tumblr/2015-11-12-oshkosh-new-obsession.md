One of the things I love the most is to dress up my little princess, but you know, I’m a stay home mom and the budget to buy clothing for her is not much so I have to get creative. I visit the malls in the middle of the week, believe me, sometimes they have really good discounts especially at the end of seasons. &nbsp;I recently discovered Osh Kosh, oh my heaven they have the cutest things! &nbsp;I found this awesome striped shirt with a peter pan collar that I felt in love with instantly. &nbsp;This shirt can be wear with jeans and dress up pairing it with tights and a cute skirt! Also, for the longest time I have been looking for desert boots for Lauren and I found them there. &nbsp; They are perfect for fall and winter and can be worn with dresses, skirts, jeans, overalls, etc. &nbsp;I went on Columbus Day and their stuff was 20% off and at the register they gave me another percentage off for signing up for something I don’t remember what was it. But so you have an idea the shoes were $20 and they ended up being $15 originally $40. I’ll definitely be going back soon to buy more! But let me remind you that the best time for shopping is at the end of the seasons and during the week when there is not much people! I’m excited to show more how to pair this two pieces!
