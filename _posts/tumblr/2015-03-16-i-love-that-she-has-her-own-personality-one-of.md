I love that she has her own personality. One of her favorite accesories is hats. She wear them in winter, spring, sumer and fall. The first Hat she wore was my winter hat and called herself super Lauren when she had it on. Sometimes she wouldn’t leave the house if the hat she wanted was missing!In many ocations I wanted make her go with out it so I could leave the house sooner, but I didn’t think it was fair. I love seen her grow and become her own and there is nothing more satisfying than that!
