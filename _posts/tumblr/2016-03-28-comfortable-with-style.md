It’s been a long time since I post on the blog, but I have a great excuse, a new baby! &nbsp;And with this baby come a lot of new responsibilities. I seriously admire those moms who have more than one kid and are out and about. &nbsp;Right after my baby was born, of course my clothes didn’t fit &nbsp;and for the first two months it was ok, because I didn’t have to go anywhere, but when it was my time to go grocery shopping, I had nothing to wear. &nbsp;Maternity pants where already too big but my regular pants where not fitting my temporary expanded hips! So my best option was leggings. Here is a secret when I wear them, I hate that leggings can be see-through sometimes so I wear two, one on top of the other one. &nbsp;Also when I wear them I need to have a long shirt to cover enough. &nbsp;What better option than this awesome button down shirt from H&M. &nbsp;The fabric is so thin and fresh and absolutely comfortable. Similar options [here](http://www.hm.com/us/product/38871?article=38871-B#article=38871-B), [here](http://www.hm.com/us/product/43524?article=43524-B), [here](http://www.hm.com/us/product/38871?article=38871-D),[here](http://www.hm.com/us/product/41154?article=41154-A)and [here](http://www.hm.com/us/product/44469?article=44469-A). Besides offering full coverage, as a nursing mom it offered easy access without having to lift my shirt up.

Now let’s talk about the shoes, these penny loafers shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I own! The whole shoe is very soft, I could walk for hours on them and they are from Gap Outlet and you can get them [here](https://lookastic.com/women/grey-suede-loafers/shop/gap-suede-loafers-156850)!

I also found for this season the perfect shades at Marshalls. It took me a long time to find the ones with the right shape, but I can always count on Marshalls to get me something close to what I’m looking for. &nbsp;

And finally the purse, I really don’t like diaper bags and my husband know that. &nbsp;He got me for my birthday this awesome bag, also from Marshalls, to replace the one I own. &nbsp;With my diaper bag I always fight it to keep it on my solder, but with this Steve Madden purse I don’t have that problem, it always stays on my shoulder. &nbsp;Of course since it’s big I can fit anything I want in it. I don’t know if there is more at Marshalls, but Target carries a similar one and you can shop [here](http://www.target.com/p/women-s-striped-weekender-handbag-navy-white-merona/-/A-16634587#prodSlot=_1_3)!

I hope this Ideas inspire you a little and help you to be comfortable and look cute at the same time!
