With the temperatures dropping, I’m getting so excited to dress up my bump. I hate spending money on maternity clothes and the only reason for this is because buying clothes to wear for a short period of time doesn’t make me happy. I don’t want to be wearing my husband’s sweat pants, even though they’re super comfy, I want to look cute! So, I bought basic things I could mix with my regular clothes. An example of this is this super cute and extremely comfortable T-shirt dress. I got this at H&M on sale for $10. It’s a summer dress and other wore it also with black sandals and a cute hat. But now that is getting cooler it is so easy to transition it to a fall outfit. I just throw a brown and black striped cardigan on that I got from Marshalls for $20 and brown boots by Madden girl, I purchased this boots at Macy’s on sale as well for $25. So if you don’t want to spend a lot of money on maternity clothes, find key pieces that you can combine with the clothes you already own! I hope this post give you some ideas of how to dress up your bump and how to mix you maternity clothes, with things you already have in your closet!
