I found this blog post from April last year &nbsp;and &nbsp;I realized I hadn’t share it. &nbsp;Maybe because it was too vulnerable, &nbsp;but after reading it today I wanted to post it. Mainly because it was the beginning of my route to a healthier life. So here it is:

My whole life I’ve been so worry about my weight, &nbsp;like I’m sure many women are. &nbsp;It’s been especially difficult because I tried a lot of unhealthy ways to lose weight for a long time. There were times that I really hated my body and the mirror was my worst enemy. &nbsp;But, as my daughter is growing I started to think that I didn’t want her to grow up thinking the same way I do. &nbsp;I want her to grow up accepting her body, &nbsp;just the way it is and to be healthy.

To be able to teach her those things there is only two things I have to do, &nbsp;and those things are accept my own body and start being healthy.

To be able to accept my body, &nbsp;I have to realized that no matter what I do I’m never going to look like Victoria Secret’s model. &nbsp;I’m a 5'2 curvy women. &nbsp;I have to be realistic, &nbsp;but just because I can’t look like a model doesn’t mean I’m not beautiful in my own way. There is so much more than being skinny. &nbsp; I’m trying really hard not to compare myself with others, and I’m &nbsp;guilty of doing this all the time and it drains a lot of my energy; energy that I could be using to do something good for myself. &nbsp;Another thing I do is that, I never accept a compliment &nbsp;from others. &nbsp;When my husband tells me that I look really pretty, &nbsp;the first thing I say is “Oh, no. &nbsp;I look so fat!” &nbsp;When he sees me without make up and tells me how much he loves my natural beauty, &nbsp;the first thing I say is, &nbsp;"Oh my gosh no, &nbsp;I look like a zombie!“ &nbsp;(why do I do this!?) It makes me really sad to think that my low self-esteem is just my own fault! &nbsp;And I don’t want my daughter to save those responses in her precious little brain. My goal is to keep in mind that being realistic will help me to set achievable goals. I’ll stop comparing myself with others for ones and for all, I will accept compliments for those around me and I will say thank you, instead of saying how awful do I really think I look. &nbsp;I’m hoping with some practice I’ll believe them myself sooner than later.

Being healthy is one of the hardest things I have to achieve, mostly because I love chicken nuggets, &nbsp;hamburgers, &nbsp;chips, &nbsp;tacos, &nbsp;and any type of sweet treat. &nbsp;I know I can do this, &nbsp;is just hard when my toddler’s lunch looks better than mine. &nbsp;I actually just started with my path to healthiness. &nbsp;I &nbsp;am trying to work out at least 3 times a week. &nbsp;My husband is been telling me for the longest time to lift weights. &nbsp;I didn’t want to do it because, I just wanted to be skinny &nbsp;not muscular! &nbsp;I can’t believe I waited this long to do it. &nbsp;Lifting weights makes me feel super good! &nbsp;I feel strong and confident. &nbsp;So far I still have my muffin top, &nbsp;but I’m learning to love this way of working out. &nbsp;For those of you who struggle like me, I feel your pain and you’re not alone. &nbsp; I just wanted to share this post to vent and to let you know that my life is not perfect and I’m just like you. &nbsp;Until next time, &nbsp;Xoxo!
