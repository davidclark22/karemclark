I’ve been wanting to create a blog for a while.&nbsp;I finally found the courage to do it. Today I want to talk about fashion! I have always read fashion blogs and I think that they are really good and very inspirational.&nbsp;They helped me a lot to figure out how to educate myself about fashion. &nbsp;I’m a mom and sometimes fashion seems&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;ridiculous when you experience sleep deprivation. But, I’m really passionate about it, so I decided to share some of the things I’ve learned. I promise it is not as hard as it seems.&nbsp;The first thing we have to understand about fashion is that you have to find your own personal style.&nbsp;Style is not about what everyone else is wearing, but it is about&nbsp;expressing&nbsp;yourself and showing the&nbsp;world&nbsp;your personality. Here is a quote I love from Rachel Zoe, a famous stylist, “Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak.” &nbsp;If you are like me, discovering at 28 years old that you&nbsp;haven’t&nbsp;find your style, I&nbsp;encourage you to get&nbsp;inspiration&nbsp;from other people, things and places.&nbsp;Try&nbsp;different&nbsp;styles and just have fun! &nbsp;In the end you will find the style that makes you feel like yourself.
