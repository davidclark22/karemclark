It’s the New Year and I’m so excited to start with new goals and projects! That is usually what we all do right? Let’s hope we can all accomplish what we want this year! Anyway, it has been a while since I posted on the blog and I have missed it, but if you are a mom you know how hard it is to keep up with hobbies. Today, I’m excited about this post, because this boyish style is one of my everyday favorites! Boys look well-put-together most of the time and with little effort. &nbsp;In this blog post I want to mention some of my favorite clothing I copy from boys, especially from the preppy style.

I want to start talking about oxford button down shirts. They are so versatile, you can wear them during the summer and layer up during fall and winter. I have to admit, I own more than a couple, just because they always make me look like I invested more time on my outfit than what I actually did.

Another of my favorites is toothpick corduroy pants. Cords are a little dressier than jeans, but still casual and comfortable. My husband owns several and they look great. They are great for cold weather, because they are nice and warm. These type of pants can add a nice texture to your outfit!

Now I want to talk about my coat. &nbsp;I’ve had this coat since 2012, and it’s still my one “go to” coat. This type of tweed over coat is the perfect length and style, it’s a classic and timeless piece. You’ll definitely want one in your closet! And, to add more awesomeness, it was only $35 at H&M!

The last thing about my outfit I want to talk about are these desert boots. They are perfect for this Texas weather, especially when it’s cold in the morning and kind of warm in the afternoon. They are also super comfortable (not only boys get to be comfortable with cute shoes). The shoes definitely help bring together the whole outfit.

I absolutely love this style because I don’t feel like I have to wear makeup. I’ve tried to dress like this and did my makeup, but I just don’t feel they go well together. It’s liberating! So, if you are looking for something cute to wear and is also comfortable, you should give this style a try! As always, thank you so much for stopping by! Xoxo
