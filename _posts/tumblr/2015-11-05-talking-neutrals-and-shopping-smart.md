This second family session was capture for one of my dearest friends. &nbsp;I want to share the pictures with you so it might help you to get some ideas for what to wear for your family pictures, but also to re-state how easy is to coordinate outfits when you wear neutrals. &nbsp;We did not buy outfits for this session, we dress with things we already had in our closet.

What I wore:

-H&M cream sweater that I purchased 3 years ago, it is super soft and I can wear it casual and formal. You definitely want to find this type of piece to add to your closet.

-Midi skirt is from Geranium boutique, a boutique from St. Louis, MO. This is one of my favorite skirts I own, the color is super versatile and I can wear it year around. &nbsp;I got it on a navy blue color because blue can be pair with almost any color.

-Brown belt, I purchased this from a thrift store for a dollar like two years ago.

-Necklace if from Geranium boutique as well. &nbsp;This was a present from a friend who has an amazing taste for clothes.

-Finally the shoes. This is probably one of my favorite finds from Nordstrom Rack. &nbsp;Vince Camuto, one of my favorite shoe’s designers! This ankle wedge booties were purchase on sale with an extra 25% off. They were marked down almost 80% off and they make my life brighter!

What Lauren wore:

-DKNY denim baby blue dress that we purchased for her in a random day at Costco. She and I felt in love with this dress instantly. &nbsp;She used it during summer and winter. We just added a couple things to make it suitable for a colder season.

-Old Navy ivory long sleeve bolero and tights. &nbsp;I purchased these both on sale. &nbsp;Her shoes are also Old navy, but I got them on a thrift store for a dollar! &nbsp;

It is so easy to combine outfits for family pictures using these colors, neutrals are timeless! You don’t have spent a lot of money getting ready for pictures, if you shop smart you can have a lot of options when it comes to picking the right outfit! I also wanted to help you understand that you don’t have to spend a lot of money dressing up. &nbsp;There are so many ways you can get really good deals when you shop in a variety of stores and to take time to look for deals!
