Hello,

I hope everyone is having an amazing day! Today I want to talk about one of my favorite go to outfits. My everyday pieces are definitely t-shirts and jeans. &nbsp;But not any t-shirt, this black is one of my favorite from all time. &nbsp;It’s made of linen and I love it for two reasons. First the fitting, I love baggy t-shirts, but the way the shirt fits it has to be right. &nbsp;Cotton t-shirts don’t weigh that much, so they don’t fall right on my body. &nbsp;Linen t-shirts are a little heavier and even though they are still baggy, they mold better on my body shape. &nbsp;When I tuck it in the front, it folds flat, cotton ones &nbsp;look like you have extra fabric and you didn’t know what to do with it. The second reason is that, all my cotton t-shirts get wholes. I don’t know how this happens, but even after the first wash there is a whole in the front. &nbsp;In my opinion I think that linen is a stronger fabric. I seriously wear this T at least once a week, and still in great shape. &nbsp;Some places you can get them are **[H&M](http://www.hm.com/us/product/38261?article=38261-G&cm_vc=SEARCH#article=38261-F)**, [**Zara**](https://www.zara.com/us/en/woman/t-shirts/short-sleeve/short-sleeve-t-shirt-c401008p4471517.html) and [**Gap**](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?vid=1&pid=524872032). I got mine on sale, this black one is from H&M and it was only $10. I also have a gray one that I got from Gap, for only $6. You should give this ones a try, they are very thin and comfortable. I should warn you that they are baggy, so you might want to buy a size smaller for a more snug fit. But if you are like me and love baggy/boyfriend fit you should get your normal size. &nbsp;You need this type of clothes when you are busy with mom duties!

The jeans are my all time favorite. I own two blacks and one dark blue. I have mention in other posts that I love dark pants because they are very easy to dress up and down. And when you wear them with a T-shirt and sandals, it still look like you put more effort on your outfit than what you actually did! Now I’ll tell you why I love this jeans so much. They are by **[H&M](http://www.hm.com/us/product/96262?article=96262-A#article=96262-A)**, they are super skinny, high waist and extremely stretchy! These jeans keep everything in place and when you bent over, you don’t have to worry about showing too much on the back! The fabric is also different, they are more like pants, but somehow look like jeans too. &nbsp;The great thing about the fabric is that the color doesn’t fade. &nbsp;So if you are looking for jeans/pants that you can dress up and down, this are the perfect ones for you! I hope this tips help you a little when you want to go shopping. &nbsp;As moms it is so hard to find the time and the energy to get dress to run errands, but this is like my uniform. It is so much easier to get ready when you know which pieces are your everyday ones!
