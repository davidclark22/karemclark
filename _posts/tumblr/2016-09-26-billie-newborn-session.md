It’s so crazy how fast &nbsp;time goes, William is nine months already and I can hardly believe it. After four years of not having a baby at home certainly was rough on me. &nbsp;I was very stressed out about the size of the baby, Lauren was nine pound 11 ounces, she was a week late and she was huge, so I was glad when I got induced with Billie right after I turned 40 weeks. He was eight pounds 14 oz. And if you haven’t gone to the chiropractor while pregnant, I highly recommend it, it made my delivery so much easier, &nbsp;only four pushes and he was out. &nbsp;But anyways that’s not even the hard part, the hard part is the sleepless nights and trying to figure out how to battle colics. I had forgotten about all of this. When &nbsp;Lauren was a baby we used to sleep during the day together, but now that she was older and she needed me during the day, it was very hard to find the time to rest. &nbsp;I’m very glad my mom and David were helping out, otherwise I would have gone crazy! I admire all those moms that have babies 18 months after you have your first one, I can only imagine how hard it is.

Now that I got that out of my system, everything I went through again is obviously worth it. This little one has brought us so much joy, I can’t even explain how much. &nbsp;I was very nervous I was not going to be able to love my little Billie as much as I love Lauren, but oh boy was I wrong!? I can believe how capable is my heart of loving this much two little people. &nbsp;Now I know how the Bachelorette feels at the finale! LOL, just kidding. But seriously, Getting up at night to feed him is so hard, but once he is in my arms I just treasure that moment, because I know he won’t be this little ever again. I love him so much and I’m so happy he is part of our lives now!

Thank you so much to Jillian of course, for these wonderful pictures. &nbsp;I told her I wanted something very minimal and simple. She delivered exactly what I asked for. She picked the right amount of details and the colors. I hope his pictures inspired you! Check her work [HERE.](http://www.jillianfarnsworthblog.com/)

For our session I wore a cardigan from Banana Republic. &nbsp;I love this one because it added some texture to my outfit. Underneath I wore a Maternity white shirt from Gap. I used this shirt all summer and I just added the cardigan, it was super versatile! And my must have from pregnancy are this maternity black leggings from H&M. &nbsp;I lived on this ones, they are so comfortable and soft, They got with everything! You’ll need a pair this fall and winter! I don’t like doing matching outfits for the family, I like having a little cohesion without making it matchi matchi. I focus on basic &nbsp;and timeless colors, and I always say no to strong patterns.

Anyway, I hope this photo session inspire you if you are looking for some newborn pictures ideas. Thank you so much for stopping by, you rock! And see you next time! Xoxo
