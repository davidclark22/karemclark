There are many things I’m passionate about, but Motherhood is by far the most important in my life. So it’s very confusing to me that I used to feel so depressed, overwhelmed and angry all the time, when my second baby was born. Well, let’s face it, I still feel that way sometimes. Yes, Motherhood is hard and who says otherwise, please teach me your ways! But going back to this dark period in my life, I never felt this depressed before. I know It had to do with moving to a new city, living behind our wonderful life, people I love and a city that felt like home. To top that I was having a baby and adjusting to be a mom of two. Everything felt so overwhelming. I felt like I was not a good enough of a mom and besides being a mom, there was nothing else for me to be good at. It was a very hard adjustment, but &nbsp;there are little changes I did in my life, that helped me overcome mostly this period in my life. &nbsp;I needed to do something for my own well-being.

When I say I needed to do something for me, I mean that I needed to find things that motivates me. I needed to do things that I love and things that I’m passionate about. &nbsp;Motherhood is great, but when you spend all your days cleaning up the kitchen, cooking meals all day, sweeping the floors, washing the same clothes every week,( you get the point right?) it is extremely discouraging. Even my husband had to offer to pay me $10 a week if I did the dishes every night before bed, to motivate me. That was amazing, lol. But that was not enough to make me feel happy. &nbsp;One day I was on Instagram and I came across with Ivanka Trump’s page (let’s pretend she is not related to the president), and she had an article on her blog titled &nbsp;“7 Off Duty Habits That’ll Make You Smarter” and she had seven points that I absolutely love, and I want to share them with you, because they had helped me so much. Here they are

1. Tune into podcast  
2. Keep a Journal  
3. Replace Hulu with Skillshare  
4. Hang out with people who are smarter than you  
5. Take a dance class  
6. Do random new things  
7. Set aside time to do nothing at all  

These seven points basically brought me back to life and got me full of positive energy. I started to listen to audiobooks and to &nbsp;watch Ted talks. The experiences people share on those platforms, are very inspiring and motivating. &nbsp;It makes you feel like you can do anything you want to, if you set goals and keep on pushing. I started a journal, but specifically for my emotions and how I deal with them, and also for ideas that I had and how could I make them possible. Writing down things help me not to forget what my new perspective in life is.

I didn’t replace hulu, but I discover the Skillshare app, that has help me so much with my photography. I’m not a professional or anything close, but I have learn a lot of things that &nbsp;had help me to get better at taking pictures and to use my camera in a better way than I used to. Also learning about photography has helped me to keep going with this blog. I love talking about fashion, I have love it since I was a little girl. I also love to write things that could be useful for someone out there. So working on these things are very therapeutic for me.

An actually one of the biggest changes I have experienced Is my exercise habits. I started to do powerlifting, and &nbsp;that is something I promised my self I would never do, because I was going to look like a very muscular men! But I gave it a chance and It has change my life in a way I could never imagine. It is very hard to workout so early (5am), but it makes me feel happy and I start my day with a smile and relaxed. I had no idea that by trying new things I was going to find my favorite workout ever! I was very thankful for this article, it really made me a more positive and productive person! I definitely have a lot of things to work on, but I’m really happy I don’t feel sad, and angry and unmotivated.

If you read all the way here, you’re awesome! And thank you for stopping by. I just wanted to share this with you guys in case someone needs help navigating through motherhood. Don’t think that everybody’s life is perfect. We all struggle! Please share with me how do you deal with motherhood and the activities that makes you happy. I hope this would help someone a little bit. I’ll see ya next time! Xoxo
