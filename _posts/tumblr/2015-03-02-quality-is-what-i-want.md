Have you ever wore a couple times a blouse or t-shirt that you bought in a cheap store like Forever 21, and then you realized there is a hole on it? One thing I can tell you, I finally understood that buying quality clothing is better than buying quantity. I always thought that buying more clothes and not worrying about the quality would make my closet bigger; sadly that’s not the case. &nbsp;I find myself buying clothes every six months because the pieces I own wear out so fast. I can’t even wear it for the next season. &nbsp;Tired of spending money and not being able to keep wearing some of my favorite clothes, I turned to my husband’s closet. I took a look and I found pieces he had bought 5 years ago and looking in a good shape. His secret was to buy good brand clothing. (who knew?!) When he buys his basic pieces, he tries to get really good quality stuff, because he uses them a constantly and good quality clothes last longer. &nbsp;He shops in places like Marshalls, TjMax, Nordstrom Rack, [Macys,](http://www.macys.com/) [JCrew](https://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp), [Banana Republic and Gap](http://bananarepublic.gap.com/). He also never pays full price. &nbsp;He always buy his stuff at the end of the season so he gets really good discounts. &nbsp;I started to follow his lead, and believe me; I have notice a big difference in my closet. I now shop in the same stores and I can tell my wardrobe is slowly getting bigger and I get to wear my favorite t-shirts for more than six months. &nbsp;I would probably still buy in cheaper stores like H&M, &nbsp;but my basics I’ll definitely buy them from a better quality place so it last longer!
