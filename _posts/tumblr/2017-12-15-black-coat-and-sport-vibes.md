It has been a while since the last time I posted. I feel like I needed a break from social media interaction. When you feel forced to do things, it’s just not fun anymore. And I definitely do this because I love it, but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming. So after a needed break, I’m back!

Today I was thinking about coats, specially because it’s finally cold here in Texas and I can wear them. My coats are usually very formal but that doesn’t stop me from giving it a sporty twist. &nbsp;I don’t really know the brand of my coat, but I got it in a thrift store for a very low price. Anyway, the brand is never important to me, what it’s important is the style. I loved it because it is just classic and &nbsp;it is a hundred percent wool. It is very thin, so I love that it doesn’t look bulky. It is oversized, but the arms are fitted. It is definitely a favorite one.

I really like being comfortable, so, sporty style is a great way to go. Wearing a fitted hoodie under the coat, gives it that vibe, but also it keeps your neck warm; functional and stylish! I really like black and dark colors so I paired this coat with a navy blue hoodie and black leggings. To add a little bit of contrast and color, I thought a light gray hat and purple and blue trainer shoes were the perfect addition.

I usually dress like this When I have to run errands or &nbsp;to take my daughter to school. The coat makes the outfit a little more put together. So when you’re in the look for coats try classic styles, so you can have fun mixing it up!

As always, thank you for stopping by, and for your support! Xoxo
