Hello my beautiful readers, today I want to talk about why dressing simple is so versatile and efficient. Do you ever feel like you have a full closet with no clothes to put on? I’ve been there, and my solution was to turn to my husband, because I don’t know anyone more efficient and with a more versatile wardrobe than him. He has pieces of clothing that can match with anything in his closet. For example, the shorts he owns are very minimal (no big cargo pockets). He has different shades of blue, gray and khaki, so any t-shirt, polo or button up shirt he owns goes perfect with his shorts. I translated that in to my own closet. You can take a look and most of my clothes are those colors. A wonderful example of that is this dress I’m wearing. I’m a mom and I love dressing up, but I don’t have the time to think every day how to combine outfits. This dress goes with everything! From sandals, to high heels to sneakers, you name it. Blue can go with almost any color so it was very easy just to grab my sandals and my summer purse and I was ready to go. This dress is also comfortable because is stretchy cotton, but thick enough it could be easily dress up. It is from Tj MAx. &nbsp;When you know the basic colors that go well together, you spend less time deciding and more time to getting things done. I hope this is helpful for you guys.

Thank you so much for stopping by and for your constant support. &nbsp;Love ya!

See you next time. Xoxo
