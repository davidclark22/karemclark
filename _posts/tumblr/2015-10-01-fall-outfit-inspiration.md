Fall season is my favorite season of all times! And of course I love having pictures taken of our family. This was our second session as a family and I had lots of fun picking the outfits! &nbsp;For pictures I definitely like to use solid colors and mainly for two reasons. &nbsp;First, I like neutrals and soft patterns because that way the pictures won’t look too busy with patterns, crazy colors and the background, they are also easy to match with the rest of the family. &nbsp;And second, because when you hang your pictures on the walls, they would go with any decoration you have at your home.

So this is what we chose to wear for our pictures,

My husband is wearing a [Gap](http://www.gap.com/) blazer, IZOD Oxford slim fit button down shirt from [Macy’s](http://www.macys.com/), [Gap](http://www.gap.com/) jeans, brown belt and brown Sperry boat shoes.

My daughter is wearing a Target head band, Calvin Klein faux fur vest, long sleeves onesie and jeans from [Gap](http://www.gap.com/), and Jack and Jill shoes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

I’m wearing a cardigan and tank top from [Marshalls](http://www.marshallsonline.com/), [Macy’s](http://www.macys.com/)necklace, Wet Seal jeans and Madden Girl brown boots from Marshalls as well.

I used a soft patter on my cardigan but I stayed with the same color scheme, my daughter had some texture and pop of color on her outfit and my husband wore some blue, a different color that broke the matchy-matchy feeling. We had a lot of fun choosing what to wear! &nbsp;I hope this post give you some ideas and help you a little bit to make the process of picking family outfits a little easier!
